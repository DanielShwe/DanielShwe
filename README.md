# About Mg Htoo

Hi, I am Win Htoo Shwe, you can call me Mg Htoo.  Anyway, I was a CIW-certified web professional way back to 2006, worked as a web administrator for a couple of years, and then as a freelance web designer for nearly a decade until 2013 when I started my own small e-commerce business called, Myanmar Lifestyle.  And I am returning to frontend development from scratch.
